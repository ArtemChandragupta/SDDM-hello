# SDDM hello theme!

This theme is a fork of https://store.kde.org/p/2059021 theme for my personal use, because i love Apple hello lettering. In original theme there was a KDE clock module, which need whole KDE to be installed on your PC, so the main goal of this fork is to bring this theme on non-KDE environments.
For now it is just an image, but later i might include an animation.
